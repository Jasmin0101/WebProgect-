                        <p>HTML is the publishing language for the World Wide Web. Behind
                        the scenes, every document you see on the Web &nbsp;-&nbsp; whether
                        covering the national news, giving information about university
                        courses, selling books or describing a local cat show &nbsp;-&nbsp;
                        is written using HTML. But why is HTML necessary? Why is a browser
                        needed to display HTML documents, and what is the role of the
                        server? These questions, as well as simple descriptions of Java,
                        scripting, multimedia and other Web-associated technologies, form
                        the subject of this chapter.

                <h2>1.1    Simple use of the Web</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>From your home in the United Kingdom, in the small English town
of Chipping Sodbury, you decide to find out what entertainment there
is in Bath, the famous city only 15 miles away. A company publishes
<em>What's On in Bath</em> online, and you have read that this is
available on http://www.bath.info.uk/ as a series of Web `pages' on
the Internet. You decide to take a look. You switch on your computer
and start it up in the usual way. Just as you might click on an icon
to start up your desktop publishing package, so you click on the
icon to load your World Wide Web browser. The browser is a piece of
software that allows you to display certain kinds of information
from the Internet.

<p>Your modem, which connects your computer to the telephone line in
the street via an ordinary household telephone socket, makes a
series of electronic beeps as it dials up the nearest Internet point
of presence and puts you onto the 'Net. Via the interface provided
by your Web browser, you can now enter the Internet address,
otherwise known as the URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, of the file
containing the front page of <em>What's On in Bath</em>. As with all
other information on the Web, this would start with `http://', for
example:


<pre>
    http://www.bath.avon.uk/
</pre>

<p>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the name of the Web's own
transmission protocol. Web pages are sent over the Internet to your
computer courtesy of HTTP.

<table><tr><td >

<h3>The difference between the Web and the Internet</h3>
    <p>Do not make the rather common mistake of confusing the Web with
    the Internet itself: the Internet simply provides the medium for the
    Web to run on, just as a telephone line provides the medium for
    telephone conversations. What the Web does is provide the technology
    for publishing, sending and obtaining information over the expanse
    of the Internet. How the Internet actually works may be a matter of
    interest, but the Web user does not need to know about it in any
    detail.
    
    <h3>Protocols</h3>
    
    A protocol consists of salutations exchanged between computers:
    `good morning', `be with you in a tick', `file coming down the line
    now' and so on. Each service on the Internet has its own protocol:
    its own personal way of sending files around the system. The
    protocol for the Web is HTTP. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is
    another common protocol of which you may have heard.
    </table>
    <p>This fictitious home page would have perhaps a photo showing the
        famous Roman Baths on the first page, together with a short
        paragraph introducing the town, and a menu of icons that call up
        specific information on Bath's museums, parks, bus-tours and so on.
        These icons provide hypertext links for you to click on-screen
        `buttons', enabling you to home-in on the information you want.
        Hypertext links are in many ways the most important feature of the
        Web. In the case of our imaginary Web pages, clicking on hypertext
        buttons mostly displays data that is held on computers somewhere in
        Bath itself. Sometimes, however, a hypertext link may fetch a file
        from somewhere quite different on the Internet. If you click on the
        title of a play taking place in Bath, information about the
        performing company may be fetched across the Internet from a
        computer thousands of miles away in the United States. From that
        point on, you might be able to call up pages that tell you about
        other plays by the same company. With the Web, you can depart on
        your own private `tour' of information on a chosen subject whenever
        the inclination takes you. This is by virtue of the hypertext links
        that span the globe.
        
        <p>You can also pay for goods and services over the Web. You could,
        for example, decide to order some tickets for a play by filling in a
        form displayed on a `page' of an online magazine. You might buy a
        $20.00 seat for <em>`As You Like It'</em> at the Bath Playhouse and
        then pay by credit card. The example below is taken from a different
        application on the Web. You can see now what a Web page looks like.
        
        <p>You can see on-screen buttons to click on: these are the
        hypertext links. There are two types: underlined words and pictures.
        These buttons serve to fetch up new information across the Internet.
        Also, you can see the title of the page and a URL at the bottom of
        the screen telling you from where the information originated.
        
        <p> [FIGURE movienet screen]
        
        <p>Looking at this screen and other pages from the Web, you can see
        that the Web provides the following:
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>A means for publishing online information. The Web enables
        you to lay out text and graphics of the `pages' on the screen, and
        to insert titles, photos, captions and so on.</p>
        
        <li><p>A means for retrieving online information via hypertext links,
        at the click of a button. You can also use Web search programs to
        find the information you want.</p>
        
        <li><p>An interface for looking at information retrieved. This is
        done by virtue of a Web browser.</p>
        </ul>
        
        <p>A Web page may also contain forms for conducting commercial
        transactions across the Internet and include other applications; for
        example, spreadsheets, video clips, sound clips and so on.
        
        <p>The Web is, therefore, simultaneously a means of online
        publishing, a way of accessing, storing and retrieving information,
        as well as a means of sending, acquiring and querying data across
        the Internet. Most importantly, the Web allows the use of hypertext
        links that can take you to any computer on the Internet. All these
        functions work by using the hardware: the wires, the cables, the
        computers, the satellite links that are used to send information
        from computer to computer using Internet protocols.
        
        <p>Before the Web, the Internet was largely the domain of computer
        nerds and others who delighted in the abstract and concise.
        Interfaces to early Internet applications required almost
        mathematical precision to operate, and programs such as FTP and
        Telnet were purely command-driven. Later, when file-retrieval
        services such as WAIS and Gopher became popular on the Internet,
        these had the advantage of being menu-driven, but still were rather
        cumbersome.
        
        <p>Although the Internet still was using interfaces suitable for the
        more technically inclined, software for home and office markets long
        ago departed from command-driven applications. The idea of a
        graphical interface using Windows, which originated from work at
        Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) in the 1970s, was popularized
        in the early 1980s, primarily through Apple Computer Inc.'s
        Macintosh computer. IBM Corp.'s Personal Computer and other
        manufacturers' PC-compatible machines followed suit with the
        introduction of Microsoft Corp.'s MS-Windows operating system a few
        years later. At the same time, windowing systems were introduced to
        the UNIX workstation market, which is now dominated by the X-11
        interface. It has, however, taken until the middle 1990s to
        introduce a simple and reliable user interface for accessing
        information over the Internet. The Web's popularity has doubtless
        been in part because it offers a simple point-and-click interface,
        which immediately makes it more accessible to a much wider range of
        users. Another important factor must have been email, which, as it
        has gained popularity, has made the idea of sending information
        across networked computers that much more acceptable.
        
        <table><tr><td>
        <h3>What is a URL?</h3>
        
        <p>This is a much-simplified explanation for the novice.
        
        <p>Given the fact that there are vast numbers of Web servers, the
        question remains of how can HTTP possibly locate just the file you
        want from somewhere on the Internet. The answer is through the use
        of the URL, the Uniform Resource Locator. This is rather like the
        telephone number of a computer on the Internet, together with
        information appended to specify the exact file to be sent to your
        machine. Taking the URL for our fictitious Web pages in Bath, we can
        see the general pattern that URLs adopt. Look at
        
        <pre>
            http://www.bath.avon.uk
        </pre>
        
        <p>more closely.
        
        <p>`http' is the name of the Web protocol used to access the data
        across the Internet.
        
        <p>`www.bath.avon.uk' is the Internet name or the domain name of the
        computer on which the information is stored. The `www' indicates
        that this is a World Wide Web server. `uk' is the country code for
        the United Kingdom.
        
        <p>To be more specific about the file you want from the server in
        question, you add to the URL a path and a file name. For example:
        
        <pre>
            http://www.bath.avon.uk/time_tables/buses.html
        </pre>
        
        <p>which would point to a file called `buses.html' in a directory
        called `time_tables'. We can imagine that `buses.html' contains bus
        timetables for the city of Bath, which can be conveniently called up
        on your screen.
        
        <p>URLs can specify files to be accessed using protocols other than
        `http'. A URL beginning with `ftp://' points to a file to be fetched
        using FTP &nbsp;-&nbsp; the File Transfer Protocol. Meanwhile, a file
        beginning with `mailto://' links to an application which allows you
        to send an email message to a pre-defined address, and `news://'
        points to a USENET newsgroup and uses the Network Transfer Protocol
        to transfer data.
        
        <p>There are various conventions when it comes to URLs. Take the
        letters `.com' for instance. These mean `company' as in:
        `http://www. microsoft.com'.
        
        <p>Non-profit organizations may use `.org' and educational
        establishments use `.edu'. Similarly, there are codes for countries.
        A URL may end in `.us' for the United States, `.fr' for France,
        `.au' for Australia and so on. Some of the conventions for URLs are
        listed in Appendices E and F.
        
        <p>How are email addresses different from URLs? Email addresses
        follow a different format: name@name.name.domain. For example:
        tiptoes@hawks. uni.edu.
        
        <p>The string of letters following the @ sign identifies the machine
        to which the mail will be sent, whereas the name of the person who
        will receive the mail is given directly before the @ sign. There may
        be more than one person logging on to the machine to read mail. That
        is why the name of the person becomes important in an email address.

                <h2>1.2    The Web in the context of the Internet</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>The Internet is a vast network of interconnected computers. Just
                        as AT&amp;T, France Telecom, British Telecom, and other countrywide
                        or regional telephone networks now are joined together to form a
                        global telephone system, so it is with the Internet. The many
                        thousands of computer networks that make up the Internet are joined
                        together on a global scale, so that any Internet computer can
                        communicate with any other.
                        
                        <p>How can your computer know how to find someone else's computer on
                        the other side of the world? Just as each telephone in the world has
                        its own unique telephone number, so each computer connected to the
                        Internet has its own computer number. This is known as its IP, or
                        Internet Protocol, address. However, because IP addresses consist of
                        long series of numbers that are cumbersome to remember and type, you
                        rarely come across them in everyday Internet use; most people prefer
                        to use the parallel system of naming computers. This is the system
                        of Internet host names, sometimes called Internet addresses or even
                        domain names. Whereas a computer on the Internet may have an IP
                        address such as 17.254.0.63, it may have a more manageable Internet
                        host or domain name such as www.drizzle.org. Servers consult a
                        globally distributed directory to map each host name onto the
                        corresponding IP address.
                        
                        <p>Once you are connected to the Internet, you can theoretically
                        `dial' anywhere you want. This gives you tremendous freedom. The
                        cost of Internet access remains the same regardless of whether or
                        not you talk to a computer in Australia, England, the United States,
                        or in the next town. This is because you pay only for the time spent
                        on the line to your nearest Internet point of presence. And, just as
                        when you make a phone call to another country, you are hardly aware
                        that your voice is traveling along foreign telephone lines, so it
                        is, theoretically, with the Internet. Although data sent from a
                        computer linked to a network in an office in Paris may travel across
                        constituent networks <em>en route</em> to Los Angeles, as a user, you
                        do not have to worry about the path it takes. The only evidence you
                        have that the requested information comes from far away is when a
                        part of the Internet system is in heavy use and you have to wait.

                        <h3>The French system Minitel is used in ways similar to the Web</h3>
                        
                        <p>It is interesting to note that the French have been using a
                        public system of information access for a number of years, which, in
                        many ways, has occupied the same niche as the Web, although not
                        nearly so sophisticated nor as versatile. Called Minitel, the system
                        consists of hardware in the form of a computer, keyboard and modem
                        originally given away free to subscribers of France Telecom, the
                        national French telephone company. Minitel is very easy to use and
                        is extremely popular &nbsp;-&nbsp; most homes have one. Minitel has
                        existed as a household `pet' for more than 10 years. Using your
                        Minitel, you dial up on the Minitel online service, and then proceed
                        through a number of menus to book yourself a seat on a train, read
                        the latest recipe for <em>la mousse au chocolat &agrav;
                        l'anglaise</em>, inspect your bank balance, book hotel rooms and so

                <h2>1.3    Basic components of the Web</h2>
                <section><p>The basic components of the Web are shown in the following
                    illustration. They are:
                    
                    <ul>
                    
                    <li><p><strong>Web servers</strong>, which are computers that hold
                    information for distribution over the Internet. In the example
                    application in the diagram, one Web server might hold the text and
                    graphics of the online magazine <em>What's On in Bath</em>, and
                    another server might hold information on which seats are available
                    for a particular concert. The magazine would be formatted using the
                    Web's own publishing language, HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language).
                    The data on available seats and their price would be held in a
                    database with links to specific forms that are published using
                    HTML.</p>
                    
                    <li><p><strong>Servers</strong>, which can be PCs, Macintosh systems
                    or UNIX workstations: it is the server software that makes them
                    special, rather than the computer itself. That said, servers need to
                    be fairly up-market machines. Servers do need to be left on all the
                    time, so that people can access the information on them whenever
                    they want. Another important point about servers: they are
                    relatively difficult to set up. If you are a non-technical person
                    who wants to publish on the Web, the best thing to do is to rent
                    some space on someone else's server.</p>
                    
                    <li><p><strong>Web clients</strong>, which can be PCs, Macintoshes
                    and other computers that are connected to the Internet and which can
                    retrieve information from Web servers. A Web client is the computer
                    on your desk. PCs, Macintoshes, UNIX workstations and even simple
                    terminals can run client software. Different client software is
                    marketed (or is given away free) for different platforms. Thus,
                    Mosaic has both a Macintosh and a PC implementation.</p>
                    
                    <li><p><strong>HTTP protocol</strong>, which is used to transmit
                    files between servers and clients. When you click on a hypertext
                    link or fill out a form in a Web document, the results need to be
                    sent across the Internet as quickly as possible, and then to be
                    understood by a server at the other end. Instructions such as `send
                    me this file' or `get me that image' are carried by the Web
                    communications protocol, HTTP. This protocol is the `messenger' that
                    fetches files to and from servers, and then delivers results to your
                    computer every time you click with a request. HTTP has its
                    counterparts in other Internet services: FTP, file transfer
                    protocol, and Gopher are protocols that obtain different sorts of
                    information from across the Internet.</p>
                    
                    <li><p><strong>Browser</strong> software, which is needed by a Web
                    client for displaying text, images, video clips and so on. This is
                    supplied under the umbrella name `browser', of which Mosaic,
                    Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer and Netscape Communications
                    Corp.'s Navigator and Communicator browsers are probably the
                    best-known examples. Browser software gives you the ability to scan
                    information retrieved from Web servers, as you would browse through
                    a book. It also gives you facilities for saving and printing
                    information obtained on the Web.</p>

                    <p>A key point that helped make the Web successful is that it is
                    multi-platform. What this means is that it does not matter what kind
                    of computer you are using; you can still view information published
                    on other, usually incompatible, machines. Thus, a PC user can access
                    information published on a Macintosh; a Macintosh can access
                    information published by a PC; UNIX users will find that they are
                    compatible with everyone. The trick is that each computer in its own
                    way can assimilate HTML. What happens when an HTML document gets to
                    its destination is up to the computer on the receiving end. It can
                    display paragraphs in Helvetica 20-point type if it pleases, and
                    headings in Times 14-point bold type, if that is the font available.
                    Whereas the document is transmitted computer-to-computer in a
                    standard format, individual browsers may display it quite
                    differently, depending on the capabilities of the hardware and
                    software in the computer on the receiving end.

                <h2>1.4    A universally understood publishing language: HTML</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>To publish information for global distribution on the World Wide
                        Web, you need a universally understood publishing language, a kind
                        of mother tongue, which all computers on the Web can potentially
                        understand. You also need a commonly understood communications
                        protocol for sending published information `down the wire' from
                        computer to computer. This should enable users to download
                        information to their machine at the click of a button, and also to
                        send back information (your address, a credit card number, a query
                        to a database and so on) with little effort.
                        
                        <p>The publishing language used by the Web is called HTML (HyperText
                        Mark-up Language). Using HTML, you can specify which parts of your
                        text are to be headings, paragraphs, bulleted lists, and which parts
                        are to be rendered in bold-face type, in italicized type and so on.
                        You can use HTML to insert tables into documents, to write
                        equations, to import images and to format fill-out forms for
                        querying databases at a distance. (Some of these features are
                        specific to HTML 3 and are not supported by earlier versions of
                        HTML.) The HTML language itself is very flexible and not difficult
                        to use, although, as with all tasks associated with computing,
                        patience is a necessary virtue for authoring hypertext. Part of the
                        Web's appeal is that almost anyone with a reasonable PC, Macintosh
                        or UNIX computer can publish information without being unduly
                        technical. Judging by the variety of publishers on the Web today,
                        HTML is within the grasp of many. A simple example of HTML can be
                        seen at the beginning of Chapter 3.

                <h2>1.5    The HTTP protocol</h2>
                <section>
                    <p> [FIGURE in margin -- long distance jump p.9]

                        <p>The initial protocol for the Web was very, very simple. The
                        client sent a request: `GET this filename' and the other end sent
                        back the file and closed the connection. And that was it. There was
                        no content type to tell you what kind of file was being sent. No
                        status code. Just the file. The client therefore had to guess what
                        it had been given and this developed into a fine art. First, the
                        browser would look at the file extension to see if there were any
                        clues, such as &dot;GIF or &dot;HTML, and then it would look at the
                        beginning of the file in case the first few bytes gave the game away
                        &nbsp;-&nbsp; all rather precarious.
                        
                        <p>Then along came MIME, a kind of multimedia extension to email.
                        This was soon adapted to HTTP so that now, when you receive a file,
                        you actually have a status code and a content type. This content
                        type tells you whether or not the file is text/HTML, video/MPEG,
                        image/GIF and so on, which gives the browser a chance to call up the
                        correct viewers to display the file. The burden of finding out what
                        kind of file it was has now moved to the server. On UNIX and DOS,
                        servers still play this game of `guess the file format'; whereas on
                        the Macintosh, this is stored as part of the file itself.
                        
                        <p>The HTTP we use today is the product of collaboration between
                        CERN and a group at the National Center for Supercomputer
                        Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at
                        Champaign-Urbana. Innovations since that time included security
                        features such as Netscape's secure socket layer (SSL), and more
                        recently, the ability to keep open the connection to the server so
                        that the server can make multiple requests. The World Wide Web
                        Consortium is looking into ways of improving this protocol, and into
                        methods of text compression that enable information on the Web to
                        arrive at its destination much quicker.

                    <p>The Web is expanding not only in terms of how much information it
                        holds, but also in terms of the variety of information it holds. The
                        figure below illustrates this general trend. On the left-hand side,
                        you can see the Web as it started, predominantly as a medium for
                        publishing information in textual form, and then it progressed to
                        include photos, diagrams and so on.

                        Web now supports a variety of media.

                        <h3>Java</h3>
                        
                        <p>At the time of writing, Java is a very popular buzzword. Java is
                        a programming language that enables programmers to write small
                        applications that are sent over the Web and then executed on the
                        client. It is an object-oriented language related to the C language.
                        What is so special about Java is that programs can be sent to any
                        machine with the right browser to understand them; furthermore, the
                        code will run safely without any risk of adversely affecting the
                        client.
                        
                        <p>From the user's point of view, Web documents suddenly become much
                        cleverer. It is as though your browser automatically creates
                        features, such as the ability to run a spreadsheet or to play a
                        piece of animation, right in front of your eyes, without you having
                        to load any extra software. The code required to do such tricks is
                        compiled into a special binary format and executed by a Java
                        interpreter in your machine. Java applications are called `applets'
                        (which means `small applications' &nbsp;-&nbsp; it would be another
                        thing entirely to send full-blown application software over the Web)
                        and are small pieces of code that rely on libraries of Java
                        `classes' in the browser. These libraries indicate that the browser
                        has a certain amount of processing knowledge resident in the browser
                        itself: the browser knows how to create a window, respond to events,
                        paint things within a window, draw text within a window and so on.
                        The applets arriving across the Web capitalize on this knowledge and
                        use the library routines to do something useful, such as displaying
                        a simple spreadsheet or a piece of animated graphics.
                        
                        <p>But, what happens if the applet calls upon a class that is not
                        available at the client end? In such cases, the class has to be
                        fetched over the Internet, a process that indeed may be rather slow.
                        For this reason, it is best to limit the number of these
                        `additional' classes.
                        
                        <h3>Scripts for HTML</h3>
                        
                        <p>Scripts are small programs, which are transparent to the user and
                        which go on `behind the scenes' fine-tuning Web pages in one way or
                        another. The author can write a script in one of several available
                        scripting languages. Scripts themselves may have one of several
                        functions. The classic function is rendering a form to seem `smart'
                        so that it interacts with you as you fill it in. Thus, you might
                        arrange for a script to check each form field in turn to make sure
                        it is properly filled in, and then to advise you if you have
                        mistakenly left out some critical piece of information.
                        
                        <p>VBScript was invented by Microsoft and is an adapted version of
                        Visual Basic; JavaScript is a Netscape scripting language and Sun
                        has tcl.
                        
                        <p>In the future, scripts may be used to create various special
                        effects, such as animation. The later chapter in this book on
                        Scripting examines some of the current and upcoming uses for
                        scripting. Scripts can also be used to tailor components of a
                        particular program, such as a spreadsheet program. In this instance,
                        application software developers will supply off-the-shelf components
                        for a program. Let us suppose that the components are for a
                        spreadsheet program; with a script, you can easily integrate
                        off-the-shelf components into the application, a feat that would
                        have previously required many programmer hours to compile. But with
                        the hypothetical script you have written, this almost seamless
                        integration happens in much the same way as it does with Visual
                        Basic; here, the components are written in a kind of systems
                        language and then, the script enables off-the-shelf components to be
                        integrated into the application itself. If scripts are half as good
                        as they promise, they can save many a programmer's headache.
                        
                        <h3>The idea of the Internet media type</h3>
                        
                        <p>If HTML can have all sorts of items embedded in it &nbsp;-&nbsp; pieces
                        of animation to be played by your browser, small programs to run on
                        your computer, and even music &nbsp;-&nbsp; then surely the browser must
                        have some way of knowing what kind of beast is coming down the line.
                        A browser can sense what type a file is and therefore it can know
                        what to do with it by using the <em>Internet media type</em>. The
                        Internet media type is a code sent with the file. The browser uses
                        this code to work out what software is needed to interpret and
                        display the data. Some examples include the following: the Internet
                        media type for an HTML document is text/HTML: for a JPEG image, the
                        Internet media type is image/JPEG.
                        
                        <p>Once the media type has been recognized and the correct software
                        called up to deal with the file, the information in the file can be
                        displayed embedded in the document; that is, it is displayed in an
                        area of the document as though it were simply part of it. Another
                        way of looking at this is that information can be `plugged in' to a
                        document. Indeed, the phrase `plug-in' is commonly used to describe
                        downloading embedded files that are not in HTML, and which require
                        software at the browser end to come to the rescue and display them.
                        
                        <p>A browser may allow, for example, a PDF (Portable Document
                        Format) file to appear down the wire. The browser sees that this has
                        an Internet media type Application/PDF. It then calls up the Adobe
                        Acrobat reader to display the PDF file. Once the media type is
                        known, the browser loads the correct application software and
                        interprets the file.

                <h2>1.7    HTML and its relationship to SGML</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>Early work on representing documents focused on rendering
                        instructions needed to print the documents. Work by IBM on GML
                        (Generalized Mark-up Language) focused on an alternative approach,
                        whereby standard document structures such as headers, paragraphs,
                        lists and so on were marked up by tags inserted into document text.
                        The emphasis on document structure rather than on rendering
                        instructions, made it dramatically easier to move documents from one
                        system to another whether for display on simple terminals, line
                        printers or sophisticated typesetting machinery.
                        
                        <p>This work led to the Standard Generalized Mark-up Language, which
                        is an international standard ISO 8879:1986. SGML enables you to
                        define a grammar for marked-up documents that defines the ways in
                        which tags can be inserted into documents. For instance, list items
                        only make sense in the context of a list, and table cells only make
                        sense in the context of a table. SGML's formal way of describing the
                        grammar is called the Document Type Definition.
                        
                        <p>Global hypertext makes worse the problem in moving documents from
                        one system to another; for example, we have Macintosh systems, PCs,
                        a variety of UNIX boxes, simple terminals and even speech I/O
                        devices for the visually impaired. SGML proved ideally suited for
                        this application. Tim Berners-Lee chose SGML to define the HTML
                        document format for the World Wide Web. HTML is formally an
                        application of SGML. The HTML Document Type Definition (DTD)
                        formally defines the set of HTML tags and the ways that they can be
                        inserted into documents.
                        
                        <p>To the uninitiated, DTDs may seem rather intimidating. This book
                        tries to act as a guiding hand to explain the HTML mark-up language
                        and how to apply it so that it creates documents for Web publishing.
                        HTML is not a static document format, but is evolving rapidly from
                        its simple beginnings as conceived by Tim Berners-Lee.

                <h2>1.8    The Web for people with disabilities</h2>
                <section><p>One of the areas in which the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has
                    shown great interest is how to make the Web accessible to the blind.
                    In the case of HTML, this has involved two things in particular,
                    discussed below.
                    
                    <p>First of all, the IMG tag for inserting images (as explained in
                    our chapter <em>Graphics on the Web</em>) is to be superseded by an
                    entirely different tag (OBJECT), which enables the browser to
                    display textual mark-up as an alternative when a visual image
                    appears on the screen.
                    
                    <p>Suppose you have a photograph as part of your Web pages. Browsers
                    will usually display the photograph as the author intended. A
                    browser used by a blind or visually impaired person will, however,
                    be set up to display a paragraph or two of descriptive text instead
                    of the photograph. This text must be included by the author for the
                    benefit of text-only browsers and may contain hypertext links,
                    itemized lists and all kinds of other mark-up. Seeing such text, the
                    browser will read aloud the words to the user and even use
                    appropriate intonation for bold, emphasized text and so on.
                    
                    <p>By including textual mark-up as an alternative to images, the
                    blind or visually impaired Web user is in a far better position than
                    previously. The still-popular IMG tag allows only very limited
                    alternative text in lieu of images and thus puts it out of favor
                    with those who rely on speech generation.
                    
                    <p>Second of all, the W3 Consortium is encouraging authors to
                    separate the <em>structural</em> aspects of their documents from
                    those aspects of the documents that are merely to do with
                    <em>layout</em>. Once this has been done, the software that enables
                    the text to be synthesized and read aloud to the blind or visually
                    impaired user has got an easier job to do. Think about it: if a page
                    is marked up solely in terms of headings, paragraphs, lists, and
                    other structural items, then it becomes much simpler to understand
                    the HTML and to render the content into speech. But the moment that
                    extraneous information about font size, alignment of text, margin
                    width, color and so on is mixed in with the general mark-up, then
                    translating that mark-up into a spoken equivalent becomes much
                    harder.
                    
                    <p>An ardent enthusiast when it comes to making the Web available to
                    the blind is Dr T.V. Raman. A clear and original thinker, Raman
                    &nbsp;-&nbsp; himself blind &nbsp;-&nbsp; has contributed widely to
                    discussions and negotiations with browser vendors on the subject of
                    Web access for people with disabilities, and also is an active
                    participant at the Math Working Group. He has also written the
                    Emacspeak Speech Interface, which is a full-fledged, speech-output
                    system that enables the blind and visually impaired to access the
                    Web with a line-mode browser within a UNIX environment.

                            <p>A new plug-in for math should be ready by August 1997. This is a
                            simple-to-use piece of software which allows easy publishing of
                            mathematical and scientific expressions on the Web. It is written by
                            Dave Raggett under the auspices of the World Wide Web Consortium.
                            </table>
                            
                            <p>This book you may notice, does not cover how to mark up math on
                            the Web. In this book's previous edition, math was inserted as a
                            chapter in its own right with the happy anticipation that math soon
                            would become part of the HTML standard. Unfortunately, that never
                            happened, and, although certain browsers have implemented the math
                            spec as it stood, for the main, math on the Web is still in the
                            wizards' pot; to be sure, there is no end of disagreement on the
                            recipe.
                            
                            <p>Just as HTML has its own Working Group, so does Math. The HTML
                            Math group includes representatives from companies who produce
                            special software for typing and editing mathematical formulae on
                            computers; examples of such software are Waterloo Maple and Wolfram.
                            There are also representatives from scientific publishers such as
                            Reed-Elsevier Ltd, as well as the American Mathematical Society.
                            Each has its own view of the correct way to do things, and Dave
                            Raggett of the World Wide Web Consortium, who did the original HTML
                            Math proposal, has his own ideas, too.
                            
                            <p>Given the widely disparate views of group members, evolving a
                            standard for marking up math on the Web is a challenge, indeed.
                            Nonetheless, the Math Working Group eventually hopes to come up with
                            a proposal for concrete notation of HTML math, with the initial
                            deployment via <em>plug-ins</em>, which is add-on software that
                            enables browsers to cope with math notation. Meanwhile,
                            mathematicians, physicists, chemists and other scientists are
                            finding it very difficult to use ordinary HTML to express
                            mathematical formulae and scientific expressions.
                            
                            <p>It is strange to think that the Web originally evolved for the
                            benefit of physicists to facilitate communication of ideas and
                            papers.

                    <h2>1.10    HTML and style sheets</h2>
                    <section>
                        <p>Both Netscape and Microsoft are at last implementing style sheets
                        for Web pages.
                        
                        <p>Chapter 9 in this book explains how to use style sheets, and
                        throughout this book you will see references as to how to use the
                        style sheet language, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to obtain the
                        layout effects you want. Cascading Style Sheets potentially gives
                        the user nearly as much control over the look and feel of material
                        as would a conventional desktop publishing package, and so, it
                        relieves HTML of the burden of non-standard extensions, rendering
                        HTML available for its proper role of structuring information. World
                        Wide Web Consortium members H&aring;kon Lie and Bert Bos, with
                        contributions from Chris Lilley, Dave Raggett and others developed
                        CSS. Microsoft is implementing CSS on its Internet Explorer browser.
